# Appendix for Slope Failure Probability Estimation coursework as a part of Risk and Uncertainty Undergraduate course 
The presented project contains a spreadsheet for a Monte Carlo simulation for probabilistic assessment of a translational land slide with two accompanying Python scripts: 
1. For convergence analysis to find the optimum number of experiments (N) required for a reasonable probability of failure estimation  
2. For standard error and confidence interval evaluation based on N = 10000
