# Slope Failure Probability Estimation with Risk and Uncertainty consideration 
The presented project contains an Excel spreadsheet that can be used for a Monte Carlo simulation for probabilistic assessment of a translational land slide with two accompanying Python scripts: 
1. For convergence analysis to find the optimum number of experiments (N) required for a reasonable probability of failure estimation  
2. For standard error and confidence interval evaluation based on N = 10000
